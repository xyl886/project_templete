# Django + Flask + Vue2 Fullstack Template

This is a project template designed for developing fullstack applications using Django, Flask, and Vue.js (version 2)
with a clear separation between frontend and backend. The project architecture follows modern development practices,
ensuring flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a template to quickly start a fullstack web application using:

- **Django** as the primary backend framework for authentication, ORM, and administration.
- **Flask** for lightweight microservices or specific API endpoints.
- **Vue.js (v2)** for a modular and responsive frontend interface.

By utilizing these frameworks, this template enables the development of complex web applications with clear separation
of concerns between the frontend and backend.

## Features

- Django and Flask both configured as separate backends, allowing flexible API development.
- Vue.js as the frontend framework, structured with single-file components for better modularity.
- Backend and frontend are fully decoupled, with the frontend consuming APIs via RESTful services.
- Configurable and extendable to suit any web application needs.

## Technologies

### Backend:

- **Django**: Full-featured backend for handling core business logic, database interaction, authentication, and an admin
  panel.
- **Flask**: Lightweight framework for building additional APIs or microservices.

### Frontend:

- **Vue.js 2**: Progressive JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Vue Router**: Frontend routing for seamless navigation.
- **Vuex**: State management for managing global state across the app.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication with Django and Flask backends.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.11)
- Node.js (version 18)
- npm or yarn (for managing frontend dependencies)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended for Python environment management)

## Backend Setup

### Django API

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd django_admin
   ```

2. Install dependencies and set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Apply migrations and start the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Django will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Flask API

1. Navigate to the Flask backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd flask_admin
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

Flask will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd vue_admin
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. Start the Vue.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run serve  # or yarn serve
   ```

The Vue frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
